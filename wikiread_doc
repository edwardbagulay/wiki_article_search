Wikiread version working (read: 1.0)

Known issues:
 - Sometimes attempts to print photos or pictures are made instead of paragraphs. This is due to the first paragraph sometimes being in the sidebar instead of the main page.
 - Exceptions are thrown for disambiguation pages. At another time, it can be properly handled.

Python 3.4 was used to make this.
