# wiki_article_search
First program ever made and worth remembering, probably many better ways to do this but I needed to make some vaguely interesting.
1. Load up your Terminal.
2. CD to the download location.
3. 'python wikiscrape whateveryouwanttosearchwikifor'
NOTE: Currently this will scrape the title and first paragraph. I've already found some refinements to make (duh).
NOTE: This will throw up exceptions if it encounters a Disambiguation page or a search page for articles not found.
